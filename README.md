# Shapes

Shapes was an exercise where we were task to recreate and example given. We were make 8 circles with different colors, and form them into a diamond in the middle of the page with them overlapping like in the example. The circles were made using HTML. The exercise helped teach how style is used to create shapes, how to layer shapes and how to position shapes.
